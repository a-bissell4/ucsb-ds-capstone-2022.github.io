# ENVENT Lab

## Project Introduction
Founded in 2016, the Energy and Environment Transitions (ENVENT) Lab at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) is a hub for climate policy advocacy, climate communication, and environmental politics research. The lab is co-directed by Prof. Leah Stokes and Prof. Matto Mildenberger.

Our capstone project is in relation to a recent endeavor of theirs; the ENVENT lab has collected over three million public opinion survey responses from around the world, all of which contains cross-national data from 2000 to the present where a climate-related question was asked in two or more countries. It is part of their greater effort towards modeling climate concern in more than 2500 subnational regions around the world, utilizing a Bayesian statistical model.

Specifically, we will joining Prof. Mildenberger and we will be cleaning and organizing covariate data from more than 100 surveys, then merging this demographic information into existing data processing routines the ENVENT lab utilizes. The goal is to develop predictive models to understand how demographic attributes (gender, income, race, age, education level, etc.) are differentially predictive of climate opinion in different countries, continents, time periods.

This project relates to the broader activities of the lab as it contributes to one of the core goals of the lab, climate communication research. Other research conducted by the lab includes polarity in regards to climate change, environmental and energy public opinion and political behavior, and democracy and political behavior.

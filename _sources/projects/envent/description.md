# Project Introduction
Founded in 2016, the Energy and Environment Transitions (ENVENT) Lab at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) is a hub for climate policy advocacy, climate communication, and environmental politics research. The lab is co-directed by Prof. Leah Stokes and Prof. Matto Mildenberger.

Our capstone project is in relation to what the main ENVENT research team has been working on. Theyâ€™ve collected over three million public opinion survey responses from around the world, all of which is cross-national data from 2000 to the present where a climate-related question was asked in two or more countries. It is part of their greater effort towards modeling climate concern in more than 2500 subnational regions around the world, utilizing a Bayesian statistical model.

So then what exactly are we doing? We are joining Prof. Mildenberger and we will be cleaning and organizing covariate data from 100+surveys, then merging this demographic information into existing data processing routines the ENVENT lab utilizes. The goal is to develop predictive models to understand how demographic attributes (gender, income, race, age, education level, etc.) are differentially predictive of climate opinion in different countries, continents, time periods.

This project relates to the broader activities of the lab as it contributes to one of the core goals of the lab, climate communication research. Other research conducted by the lab includes polarity in regards to climate change, environmental and energy public opinion and political behavior, and democracy and political behavior. 

# Summary of Datasets

We are working with a broad range of datasets spanning regions across the world, some dating back from 1998 and others all the way to the present day. Our concentration is on demographic variables related to Gender, Age, Religion, Education, Race/Ethnicity, Income, Housing type, and Number of children per household. To ensure good quality data, we source our data from sites that ensures that the interviewers were properly trained. They make sure the interviewers have the right skills and qualifications to perform the surveys. Additionally, the data we are working with are free of incomplete, improperly formatted, or inaccurate records. All respondents are randomly selected; every adult citizen has an equal chance of being selected. The surveys were conducted by different organizations so there is a slight variation between the variables and questions asked.
